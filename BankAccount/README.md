## Syntax - Challenge

Let's exercise all the content presented in the Syntax module by coding the following scenario.

1. Create the `BankAccount` project which will receive data via a terminal containing the characteristics of a bank account according to the attributes below:
2. Inside the project, create the class `ContaTerminal.java` to do all the coding for our program.

###### Review variable declaration rules

| Attribute | Type | Example   
| --------- | ---------| ------- 
| Number | Integer | 1021 
| Agency | Text | 067-8
| Client Name | Text | MARIO ANDRADE
| Balance | Decimal |237.48


###### Review terminal, main args and the Scanner class
2. Allow data to be entered via the terminal and the user will receive a message asking for the information, example:

* Program: “Please enter the branch number !”
* User: 1021 *(then ENTER for the next field)*

###### Review concatenation and String class with concat method

3. Once all the information has been entered, the system should display the following message:

*"Hello [Customer Name], thank you for creating an account at our bank, your branch is [Branch], account [Number] and your balance [Balance] is now available for withdrawal.”

The fields in [ ] must be altered by the information entered by the users.
